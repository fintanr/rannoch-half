# Loch Rannoch

Its been almost three and a half years since I last did a [half marathon](https://x.com/fintanr/status/1366002001054736386), and (with a lot of prompting from a friend) I have decided to do another one - the [Loch Rannoch Half Marathon](https://runnation.co.uk/r/rannochhalfmarathon2024) on October 13th, 2024. 

Been a while since I have done any running at all, but I guess its time to get running 🏃 again, and I plan on logging my training here. The training starts properly the week of July 22nd. The goal is just to finish and enjoy the half, nothing more. The training program is from [Hal Higdon](https://www.halhigdon.com/training-programs/half-marathon-training/novice-2-half-marathon/).
